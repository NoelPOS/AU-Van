## Project Description

AU Van is an online van booking system designed for the van service at Assumption University of Thailand. The current system relies on manual bookings through the LINE app and daily posted schedules, which can be tedious and inefficient.

Our appointment system introduces a seamless online booking process that addresses these challenges. The application features two main parts: an admin dashboard and a user interface.

**Note** : For admin, log in with testing@gmail.com and password is 123456

**Note**: When logged in with an admin email, an "Admin" button appears in the navbar for easy access to the admin page. Regular users will see standard navigation options.

### Admin Features:

- Create time slots for specific routes.
- Delete and update user bookings.
- View statistics on today's bookings.

### User Features:

- Register and create an account.
- Check the schedule for the day.
- Select a time slot and make a booking.
- View their booking history.
- Access a profile page to update their password or delete their account.

### Technology Stack

The AU Van project is built using:

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and dynamic routing, enhancing performance and SEO.
- **shadcn/ui**: A UI component library for rapid development and consistent design.
- **NextAuth**: For secure user authentication and easy sign-up/login.
- **Vercel**: For seamless deployment and optimized performance.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible data management and efficient querying.
